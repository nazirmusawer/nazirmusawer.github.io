  <h1>Books</h1>
  <p class="books-intro">
    Below is a list of books that have made a deep and lasting impact on me.
    As the adage goes, “your thoughts become your destiny” and these books have influenced my thoughts.

    <div class="book-content">
      <h2>The First and Last Freedom</h2>
      <h3>Jiddu Krishnamurti</h3>
      <p>
        About 1/4 of the way into this book I was really wondering if I could make it through what seemed like ramblings;
        a guru with more style than substance. But later I began to see how deeply he dissects the mind.

    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/books/the-road-to-serfdom.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The Road to Serfdom cover">
    <div class="book-content">
      <h2>The Road to Serfdom</h2>
      <h3>F. A. Hayek</h3>
      <p>
        This is a towering work. Though I only recently read it, it aligned with thoughts I had years ago about power,
        control, and how “good intentions” can still build cages.
