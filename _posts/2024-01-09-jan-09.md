The highlight of my day was engaging in conversations with several cousins. It's always refreshing to connect with family.

Regarding my professional interests, I'm focusing on cloud computing. Here are a few key areas I'm exploring:

Platforms: Understanding platforms like Azure, AWS, and GCP (Google Cloud Platform), including their services and models.
Programming Languages: Learning languages such as Python and Javascript, along with SQL for database-related tasks.
DevOps Tools: Familiarizing myself with automation tools like Terraform and Ansible.
Networking Basics: Gaining foundational knowledge in networking.
Security: Emphasizing the importance of security knowledge in this field.
I'm particularly curious about the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which offers a wide range of services from app engine to big data, machine learning, and more.

Reflecting on the field of cloud computing, I'm aware of the success and high earnings of professionals, especially those from Indian and Chinese backgrounds. Their luxurious lifestyles and career accomplishments sometimes spark a sense of envy in me. I often wonder about the skills and methods that led them to such success and ponder what I might be missing or could improve upon. Please excuse any errors in my English, as I'm simply jotting down my thoughts. I'm keen to understand the pathways to success in this field that seem elusive to me.
