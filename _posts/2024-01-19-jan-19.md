It is six in the morning, woke up to go to gym after four days but but I couldn’t take out my car out of the driveway? Because it snowed last night and my car cannot go through the retaining wall, what they call it, due being slippery. Urghhh!!!

PATIENCE IS THE KEY.  This apply in every aspects of our life.
