Yesterday, I sent a message to my landlord Lynda: “I think I need your mousetrap.” The reason? A tiny, dark-colored mouse had appeared in my apartment, complete with small hands and a surprisingly friendly demeanor. I wanted to snap a photo, but my phone wasn't within reach.

Setting a mousetrap near the mini-fridge, I noticed the mouse cautiously sniffing around it, but it cleverly avoided the bait. After returning from work, the mouse was still there, leading to a playful game of hide and seek that lasted until 1 a.m. Despite cleaning my room, I could still hear it gnawing away at things.

On a different note, tomorrow marks my birthday. I'll be either 34 or 35 – the exact age eludes me. Honestly, it doesn't feel particularly special; it's just another day. Perhaps this indifference stems from not celebrating birthdays much, either in my childhood or as an adult.

Thankfully, I have the day off. I plan to rest and read, with a significant focus on reaching out to PVCC’s scholarship coordinator. She represents my last hope for college funding. Otherwise, I'm uncertain about the fees required for my studies. As they say, hope is a great thing, perhaps the best of things, and it never dies!
