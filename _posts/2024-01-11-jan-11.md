Yesterday slipped by without a journal entry; I simply forgot to write.

There’s a stage in life when everything seems inconsequential, as if each effort-- working, studying, exercising-- is a mere trick of the clock. This sense of time slipping through my fingers has shadowed me for over a year. I often remind myself that it’s normal to have off days, to not always be at my best. Yet, beneath this self-assurance, a hollow feeling persists, a nagging sense that something integral is absent, leaving an unfillable void within me.
