I had two friends from Philadelphia the day before yesterday; Jalal and Zaki. We had good time, cooked, smoked, laughed. I didn’t worked on CS50 problem sets during this off days. 
As I am writing this journal, I am talking with mom in Kabul and two sisters in Perth on WhatsApp. My sisters are crazy, they are in the same room but both joined the call lol.
