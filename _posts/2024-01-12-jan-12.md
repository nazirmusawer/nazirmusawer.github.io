As I am writing this journal, it is raining outside. it began just before sunset, a soothing and rhythmic sound that has continued into the night. This is a last moment entry. 

Today I had semi-productive day. I studied for a couple of hours and submitted two problem sets for my CS50 course. Moreover, I was also able to reach out Amanda Key asking for her assistance and guidance regarding FAFSA. NFI

I smoked two joints since sunset, by the way. The experience of the high was brief, a fleeting moment of escape, yet the aftereffects, a sort of hangover, lasted longer than initial euphoria. 

Today I woke up grateful for everything I have in life. Most importantly, good health and family.

I forgot to write about yesterday’s conversation with one of new colleagues who recently joined Omni. Her name is Marissa. I learned her name not through conversation but from her name tag. Marissa, who is twenty-seven and half years old. Is battling with health challenges, including tumors in her lower mouth and on top of her right eye, and also wears braces. Moreover, Her situation is a stark reminder of the fragility of life and makes me profoundly thankful for my own well-being.
