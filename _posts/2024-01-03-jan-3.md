Today I woke as usual at 5:10am and rushed to the gym. It was my leg day; like another day but a bit intense workout. There was a girl, a hispanic, I must who was showing off her booty lol. Or maybe not, it was just my thinking. You know men... 

I drove home straight. Planned to stop by a gas station to fill up my tank but I chose to drive around the turnabout and go back to the gas station. Weird, huh?

As usual, I had oatmeal In milk with avocado, banana and walnuts. It was great... source of protein, I guess. 

While having breakfast, I talked with mom and dad in Kabul. They were fine, no complains but still I feel they are not okay living alone. Due to electricity shortage, they did not have electricity. It brought back some old memories	when I was a kid, we usually didn’t had electricity. However, there was not anything else to do during the night. I was laying on the mattress facing the wall, I was playing fingers shadow on wall. I was making different shapes and objects. My childhood was filled with such kind of memories. Dull, gloomy and regular.
