I start the day with a disheartening update from the financial aid office at PVCC. The email informed me that, since I already possess a bachelor's degree, I might not qualify for most of the programs at PVCC. My options are now limited to either applying for a loan or arranging a payment plan. This situation is incredibly frustrating.

It feels like a sea of hands, each pushing against my efforts, dragging me back every time I inch forward.
