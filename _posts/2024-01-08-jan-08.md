Today, I mused on the humorous notion that smoking a joint turns one into a philosopher, a common jest among pot enthusiasts. It's funny how they use their 'high' state to explore mental growth and development.

I couldn't get in touch with PVCC's scholarship coordinator, so most of my day was spent in rest. I had conversations with my mom, Jawid, and Saimi. My time was largely consumed by scrolling through the internet and playing PUBG.

A personal challenge I'm facing is learning to focus better and pay attention to details. This might be linked to my being cross-eyed. For example, I struggled with maintaining balance during a bench press session at the gym. I couldn't distribute the weights evenly, always leaning to one side.

Amidst these thoughts, something wonderful happened. Unexpectedly, my friends Fraidoon and Murtaza Kakar (MK for short) surprised me with a cake. It was a delightful shock, especially since I don't usually expect such gestures. Additionally, I received numerous messages from friends and family, all wishing me happiness and prosperity for the coming year. Their kind words and small acts of love and appreciation truly touched me. It reminds me that as humans, we have an innate desire to be appreciated and validated, even though some find it hard to acknowledge this need. 

This is what I plan to do everyday in order to manage my time and resources.
